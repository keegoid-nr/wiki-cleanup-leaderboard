# Privacy Policy for GTS Wiki Cleanup Competition

**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the "GTS Wiki Cleanup Competition" Forge app for Confluence ("the App") handles your information. This App is intended solely for internal use within the New Relic private Confluence space.

## 1. Information We Process

The App does not collect or store any personal information on its own servers or databases. It functions by reading information directly from the Confluence API in real-time when the macro is loaded on a page. The information processed includes:

* **Your Confluence Profile Information:** Your display name and profile picture (avatar) as configured in your Atlassian account.
* **Your Confluence Activity:** Information about pages you edit within the "SE" Confluence space, specifically page titles and the calculated character change of your edits.

This data is processed only to calculate scores and display the leaderboard for the competition.

## 2. How We Use Information

Your information is used exclusively for the following purposes:

* To calculate your score based on qualifying edits made during the competition period.
* To display your name, avatar, and score on the competition leaderboard.
* To show a list of recent page updates, attributing the edit to the user who made it.

All data displayed by the App is only visible to other authenticated New Relic users who have permission to view the Confluence page where the macro is placed.

## 3. Data Storage and Sharing

The App is stateless and **does not store any data**. All information is fetched from Confluence on page load and is discarded when you navigate away. We do not share your information with any third-party services.

## 4. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how the App works, please contact the developer, **@kmullaney**, on the New Relic Slack.
